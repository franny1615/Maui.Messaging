# Maui.Messaging

A sample repo showcasing using SignalR to create a messaging app between two clients. 

ASP Net Core Web Api with JWT Authentication is used to mock a login flow in the maui application.

Very little work is needed to implement this functionality on client or server side, so developer can focus on creating features around SignalR instead of focusing on the Web Sockets or other underlying functionality.

Below are some screenshots of running project from each client pov:
